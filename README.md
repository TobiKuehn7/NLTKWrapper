# NLTKWrapper
A wrapper for the NLP library NLTK. Containing the basic functions mentioned in the word document

## Usage
I would suggest to run it in PyCharm or another IDE because there is a lot of output which is not formatted and looks ugly in a terminal window.
1. Make a virtual environment
   1. `python -m venv venv`
   2. Run the 'activate script' (depending on the terminal you use. f.e. in powershell `venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1`)
2. Install requirements
   1. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run main.py
   1. `python main.py` / open the script in your IDE and run it
